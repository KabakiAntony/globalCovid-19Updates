# Global Covid-19 Updates

This is user interface for the [REST API](https://globalcovid19updates.herokuapp.com) in this UI we will
consume the data that comes back from the API and show it to the user.

The UI will show global data as the header that is the confirmed cases, deaths , recoveries and active cases
then we will breakdown the data into individual countries and you can search for a particular country if you
don't fancy the long scroll.
